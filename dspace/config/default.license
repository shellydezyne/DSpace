Note on Sahapedia’s Licencing Approach ____________________________________________________________________A. This document is for guidance purposes only. The purpose of this document is to highlight the copyright licencing approach that Sahapedia will follow. B. Sahapedia is committed to the Creative Commons approach – to further a system of openness and transparency in relation to its efforts to share India’s cultural heritage.C.  Creative Commons (“CC”/”the organization”) is a non-profit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools,1 founded on the idea of universal access to research, education and culture being aided and strengthened by the Internet. Recognizing that existing legal and/or social systems might not permit the true articulation of this idea of universal access, the organization provides a free, public and standardized infrastructure that creates a balance between the reality of the Internet and reality of copyright laws.2 D. CC provides copyright licenses and tools that may be used by any person to permit the use and sharing of their work, including text, pictures, videos and more. It may be noted that CC is NOT an alternative to copyright. CC licences are copyright licenses and depend on the existence of copyright to work.3 CC licences work within the copyright system and enable creators and rights holders to offer certain rights to the public while reserving some others,4 in turn encouraging the creation of a pool of legally available creative content. E. All CC licences are non-exclusive, allowing creators/copyright owners to enter into other additional licensing agreements for the same material licensed under a CC licence. However, CC licences are irrevocable once granted and cannot be terminated unless there has been a breach; and even in instances of a breach, are only terminated for the breaching licensee.5F. CC licences may be applied to literary, artistic and dramatic works. It is recommended that CC licences not be used for computer software and hardware or works already in the public domain, or works no longer protected by copyright.6G. Please note that CC licences are not revocable. Once content has been published under a CC licence, licensees may use it according to the terms of the licence for the entire duration of copyright as applicable. H. There are six different CC licenses7. Any one of these8 might be applied to her material by the user.9 I. CC Licenses have three layers, that is, a human readable deed, a legal code as well as metadata which is machine readable.10 Acceptance of the legal code is constituted through an acceptance of the licence itself, through a written document.J. Sahapedia will follow the below licence in its acquision of intellectual property from artists, experts, trusts, and other institutitons. Sahapedia will also provide a link to a human readable deed, which links to the legal code as well as embedding the machine readable metadata in the code of the licence indicator or the code of the licensed page.11Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms12.K. This licence, i.e. CC-BY-NC-SA is used to acquire content that will not be monetised / commercialised.  * CC – indicates the global Creative Commons standard.* BY – Ensures the content-originator gets full attribution.* NC – Ensures that all outputs can only be utilised for non-commercial purposes, both by Sahapedia (while acquiring) and by the user (while receiving). This is to give comfort to those from whom Sahapedia sources material.* SA – Ensures that the outputs are shared on a similar basis, thus protecting the material from being used by third / fourth / fifth parties for commercial purposes.* Absence of ND (no-derivatives) clauses – Ensures that Sahapedia’s users can make derivatives of the work, should they choose.L. Sahapedia, in adopting this approach has followed the approach of the Wikimedia Foundation that mandates the usage and hosting of content licensed under a free content licence (GNU Free Documentation Licence13 / Creative Commons AttributionShareAlike 3.0 Unported Licence). M. Since the Wikimedia Foundation is only the host of the content and has no role to play in the editorial process, it disclaims any and all responsibility for the content and therefore any liability arising out of it is disclaimed as well. This is similar to Sahapedia’s approach on liability for content over which it has no editorial control.N. This is a brief summation of Sahapedia’s intellectual property framework: * Creative Commons – similar to Wikimedia* CC-BY-NC-SA* Non-commercialisation, full attribution, ability to adapt, no liability for contentNOTE ON CREATIVE COMMONSI. Preliminary1. This section provides an overview into the Creative Commons approach to licensing of content. Six licences, including their technical details and the rights and liabilities that they encompass have been discussed; any of which may be employed by Sahapedia based on the requirements.2. Creative Commons (“CC”/”the organization”) is a non-profit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools,14 founded on the idea of universal access to research, education and culture being aided and strengthened by the Internet. Recognizing that existing legal and/or social systems might not permit the true articulation of this idea of universal access, the organization provides a free, public and standardized infrastructure that creates a balance between the reality of the Internet and reality of copyright laws.15 3. CC provides copyright licenses and tools that may be used by any person to permit the use and sharing of their work, including text, pictures, videos and more. It may be noted that CC is NOT an alternative to copyright. CC licences are copyright licenses and depend on the existence of copyright to work.16 CC licences work within the copyright system and enable creators and rights holders to offer certain rights to the public while reserving some others,17 in turn encouraging the creation of a pool of legally available creative content. 4. CC is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice or legal services. II. Types of Licences181. There are six different CC licenses. Any one of these19 might be applied to her material by the user.20 These are as under21:a. Attribution (CC-BY) - This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials22.b. Attribution- ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects23.c. Attribution-NoDerivs (CC-BY-ND) - This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you24.d. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC) - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms25.e. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) - This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms26.f. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC-BY-NC-ND) - This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially27.III. Technical Details about the Licences1. CC Licenses have three layers, that is, a human readable deed, a legal code as well as metadata which is machine readable.282. The organization recommends that the use of CC licences be clearly indicated with a CC button, or with any other marker. The organization also recommends that a link be provided to a human readable deed, which links to the legal code as well as embedding the machine readable metadata in the code of the licence indicator or the code of the licensed page.29IV. Using CC Licences1. CC licences may be applied to literary, artistic and dramatic works. It is recommended that CC licences not be used for computer software and hardware or works already in the public domain, or works no longer protected by copyright.302. All CC licences are non-exclusive, allowing creators/copyright owners to enter into other additional licensing agreements for the same material licensed under a CC licence. However, CC licences are irrevocable once granted and cannot be terminated unless there has been a breach; and even in instances of a breach, are only terminated for the breaching licensee.313. It is recommended that the latest version of the CC licences, that is, version 4.0 be used. These licenses are the most up to date and recommended (by CC) over all earlier versions.324. It may be noted that if the use of a certain material is permitted under a legitimate limitation or exception, there is no need to rely on a CC licence or to comply with its terms and conditions. CC refers to this as a fundamental principle of CC licensing.335. CC licences are legally enforceable in a court of law and contain a severability clause, allowing a court to eliminate provisions deemed to be unenforceable.6. While the terms of CC licences may be altered, after doing so, Sahapedia would not be able to call, label or describe the licence as a “Creative Commons” or a “CC” Licence. Further, Sahapedia will not be able to use the CC logos, buttons or other trademarks in connection with the modified licence. 7. Please note that CC licences are not revocable. Once content has been published under a CC licence, licensees may use it according to the terms of the licence for the entire duration of copyright as applicable. Sahapedia may stop distributing content under the CC licence at any point, but existing copies of the content/material present with anybody may continue to be distributed under the terms of the previous license. V.
